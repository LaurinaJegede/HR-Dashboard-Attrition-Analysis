📊 Workforce Composition & Attrition Analysis  

An HR analytics dashboard built in Power BI to explore workforce composition, tenure, and attrition trends.  

🧰 Tools Used  
- Power BI  
- Excel (for preprocessing)  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  


📁 Dataset  
Source: Public sample HR Employee dataset  
Content: Employee information such as gender, department, job role, years at company, attrition status, training hours, and more.  


🧠 Key Questions Explored  
- What percentage of employees are leaving the company?  
- Is attrition higher in any specific gender or department?  
- How does tenure relate to attrition?  
- Do training hours influence attrition?  

📈 Insight Summary  
Overall Attrition Rate: 16% of employees left the organization over the reporting period.  
Gender Distribution: Workforce ~60% male, ~40% female. Attrition was higher among males, suggesting possible engagement or policy gaps.  
Departmental Patterns: Research & Development and Sales had the highest turnover; HR was the most stable department.  
Tenure Trends: Average employee tenure is 7 years, but employees with <3 years at the company were significantly more likely to leave.  
Training Hours: No strong relationship between training hours and attrition in this dataset.  

These findings give decision-makers visibility into attrition risks, department-level trends, and opportunities to improve employee retention.
